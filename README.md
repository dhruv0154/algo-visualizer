## 🧰 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v

🔧 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/algo-visualizer.git
cd algo-visualizer


Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the development server:

npm start


Open in your browser:

http://localhost:3000

🎮 How to Use

Select an algorithm from the navigation bar or sidebar.

Click "Visualize" to begin the step-by-step animation.

For pathfinding:

Click to place the start, end, and walls on the grid.

Adjust speed and array size using sliders (if available).

Click "Reset" to clear the board or data.

🧠 Educational Purpose

This project is built to:

Demonstrate classical algorithm behavior through visual interaction.

Reinforce understanding of algorithmic logic.

Provide an intuitive UI to explore algorithm efficiency and flow.
